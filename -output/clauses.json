This International Standard provides requirements and recommendations (see Note 2) for the overall I&C architecture which may contain either or both technologies.\n\nThis standard highlights also the need for complete and precise requirements, derived from the plant safety goals, as a pre-requisite for generating the comprehensive requirements for the overall I&C architecture, and hence for the individual I&C systems important to safety.\n\nThis standard introduces the concept of a safety life cycle for the overall I&C architecture, and a safety life cycle for the individual systems. By this, it highlights the relations between the safety objectives of the NPP and the requirements for the overall architecture of the I&C systems important to safety, and the relations between the overall I&C architecture and the requirements of the individual systems important to safety.\n\nThe life cycles illustrated in, and followed by, this standard are not the only ones possible; other life cycles may be followed, provided that the objectives stated in this standard are satisfied.\n\nNOTE 1 I&C systems may also use electronic modules based on complex electronic components such as ASICs or FPGA. Depending on the scope and functionality of these components, they may be treated according to the guidance for conventional electronic equipment, or similar to CB equipment. A significant part of the guidance for CB equipment is also applicable to the design of equipment with complex electronic components, including e.g. the concepts of re-using pre-existing designs, and the evaluation of design errors in software or complex hardware designs.\n\nNOTE 2 In the following, \u201crequirement\u201d is used as a comprehensive term for both requirements and recommendations. The distinction appears at the level of the specific provisions where requirements are expressed by \u201cshall\u201d and recommendations by \u201cshould\u201d."

This standard distinguishes between categorisation of I&C functions and classification of I&C systems, in accordance with IEC 61226.\n\nNOTE 1 The terms \"categorisation\" and \"classification\" are sometimes synonymously used, even in IEC 61226. For the purpose of clarity in this standard, the term \"categorisation\" is reserved for the functions and the term \"classification\" for the systems.\n\nThe categorisation process places each I&C function into a category according to its importance to safety.\n\nThese categories are characterised by sets of requirements on the specification, design, implementation, verification and validation of the I&C function, as well as by requirement on the properties of the systems suitable for the categories, their qualification, the application functions, the service functions, and the system software functions of the system as appropriate. Consistent requirements apply to the whole chain of items which are necessary to implement a function of a given category, regardless of how it is distributed in a number of interconnected I&C systems. Therefore, it is practical to define classes of I&C systems which are suitable to implement I&C functions up to a defined category.\n\nThe categorisation of the I&C functions is part of the plant safety design base and is outside the scope of this standard. This standard assumes that the plant safety design base has assigned the individual I&C functions important to safety into one of three categories A, B or C and that the main design requirements for the systems and equipment associated with these categories are consistent with those of Clause 7 of IEC 61226:2009. Furthermore, the\n\nrequirements for category A are consistent with the requirements for safety systems of the IAEA.\n\nNOTE 2 The normative references for categorisation of functions may vary between countries and deviate from the reference of this standard (IEC 61226). A specific situation may also arise when applying this standard to existing plants where new categorization requirements are valid only for the parts in the scope of a modernization project. In such cases, a specific analysis may be required to identify the minimum requirements per system class.\n\nThe classification of the I&C systems is defined by the I&C project organisation in the design phase of the I&C architecture before the functional assignment of the I&C functions to the systems (see 5.4.2 and 5.4.3)."

Such an occurrence can happen if one or more latent faults are systematically incorporated in some or all redundant channels and if a mechanism exists which can trigger such a systematic latent fault of two or more redundant channels so that they fail in a timely correlated manner (see IEC 62340).\n\nThe origin for systematic latent faults is mostly related to human errors. They may be introduced in any phase of the life cycle of an I&C system. The use of computers allows more complex algorithms and processes to be used than is possible with hardware alone. Furthermore the design effort of computer based I&C, including the activities related to the design of the underlying I&C platform, is higher than for hardware I&C, and the design may be more complex.\n\nDesign choices should be evaluated with the objective to minimize the introduction of avoidable complexity.\n\nThe defence against the CCF of I&C systems includes the following levels:\n\na) A functional validation of the application functions requirements specification should be performed for class 1 systems (see 6.2.4.2.1) to reduce the likelihood of latent faults in the requirements specification.\n\nb) A clearly structured engineering process shall be performed with highest attention to all verification and validation activities, so as to reduce the likelihood of latent faults in the design. The effort should be graded for class 1, class 2 and class 3 systems.\n\nc) I&C systems of class 1 and their support systems should be designed in a way that they operate independent from influencing factors from the plant process, so as to minimize the possibility that potential latent faults can be triggered (e.g. hardware components performing PIE mitigations should not be subject to adverse environmental conditions arising from that PIE; the scheduling of software execution should not depend on the plant signals).\n\nNOTE 1 This recommendation corresponds to the requirement of IEC 62340 that I&C systems should operate independently from the \u201cplant demand profile\u201d.\n\nd) For class 1 systems, an analysis shall be performed to identify possible sources of CCF and mechanisms which could trigger postulated latent faults to cause a failure. Within this analysis special care should be given to communication links and data transmission arrangements and to components whose loading is demand dependent. The possible failure modes and the failure sequences of such components should be assessed with regard to possible sources and effects of CCF. The analysis should also include those systems of the concerned safety group which are credited to mitigate the effects of postulated CCF of class 1 systems.\n\nA design for coping with CCF is required if the postulated failure of functions important to safety would lead to unacceptable consequences. This is in general the case for category A functions, and for a subset of category B functions (see 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 in IEC 61226:2009).\n\ne) The I&C architectural design should use the principle of diversity where high reliability is required for a safety group, and hence sources and effects of CCF are to be considered. Functional, signal and equipment diversity should be considered. If diversity is used to support defence against CCF, the design shall include an analysis of the effectiveness of diverse features claimed to minimize the potential for CCF.\n\nf) Where Class 1 and lower class I&C systems are claimed in the deterministic safety case as different lines of defence effective for design basis accidents, these systems shall be independent. I&C systems perform their safety functions independently if a postulated failure of one of these I&C systems does not prevent the other systems from performing their functions as intended. Independent I&C systems shall be operated at different signal trajectories. This can be assured by diversity (e. g. by equipment diversity or functional diversity).\n\nFurther requirements concerning measures to cope with CCF in systems performing category A functions are provided in IEC 62340.\n\nNOTE 2 An activity should be performed on plant safety analysis level to verify that the design measures taken to handle/meet I&C failures will be managed by the category A/B/C functions specified. This will be an activity not only on I&C but safety analysis level and is therefore out of the scope of this standard."

Generic qualification may have been performed as a joint effort for several NPP projects, or by a vendor of an equipment platform for safety-related applications. Prequalification may also have been performed for products initially oriented towards other domains than design of nuclear power plants, not necessarily fully in line with the methods and procedures required for the project.\n\nNOTE 1 Certification of COTS products to SIL 1, 2 or 3 safety integrity levels according to the IEC 61508 series by an independent and accredited safety assessor is an example of a form of pre-qualification of COTS equipment. Since the IEC 61508 series is the umbrella standard of IEC 61513, such a certification provides a good starting point for application-specific qualification of COTS products, and for demonstrating the compliance with the requirements of IEC 61513 and its daughter standards.\n\nRelying on pre-qualification of pre-existing equipment requires that application-specific qualification is performed, in order either to confirm the compliance of the evidence of prequalification with the requirements of the I&C system, or to fill the gaps identified. This application-specific qualification may imply a variety of activities such as accepting the existing qualification results based on analysis of the existing documentation, performing audits, performing supplementary functional, environmental and seismic testing and evaluating feedback from experience.\n\na) Depending on the extent of the available documentation and evidence of pre-qualification, an appropriate qualification program shall be defined and included in the qualification plan (see 6.5.3).\n\nb) The application-specific qualification shall address the properties and characteristics not covered by pre-qualification.\n\nc) The application-specific qualification shall address the differences between the qualification methodology and procedures applied for pre-qualification, and those imposed by the system requirement specification (see 6.2.2.7).\n\nNOTE 2 Application-specific qualification typically considers the following:\n\n\u2022 that pre-qualification evidence is applicable and complies with the requirements of the I&C system;\n\n\u2022 that any gaps in the evidence are identifies and filled;\n\n\u2022 if replacing equipment, that any design differences with respect to the current equipment or system are examined and no adverse effects are confirmed;\n\n\u2022 that the acceptance and performance criteria used in pre-qualification testing are suitable for the current application.\n\nThe system qualification process may be accomplished in stages: first by qualifying the individual hardware and software components of an I&C system, and then by qualifying the integrated I&C system (i.e. the final realized design).\n\nd) The qualification of the hardware and system software of a system built up by configuring an equipment family or connecting pre-existing components may be derived from the qualification performed on individual components and configurations of interconnected components. In such cases, an analysis shall be completed to demonstrate that the qualification covers the final configuration of the system used in the plant, including mounting arrangement, load and temperature distribution inside the cabinets.\n\ne) Based on the previous analysis, the qualification plan should identify all novel features of the system design and define whether complementary qualification tests and evaluations are to be carried out."

The annex provides an overview of the contents of IAEA documents but does not intend to enhance the requirements stated in these documents.\n\nA.2 Plant safety objectives\n\nAny industrial activity that presents risks to workers, members of the public and the environment requires the operator to take all reasonably practicable measures to keep these risks low. One typical risk of nuclear energy is the potential hazard of ionising radiation (see Clause 2 of IAEA NS-R-1:2000).\n\nThe general nuclear safety objective is to protect individuals, society and the environment by establishing and maintaining an effective defence against radiological hazard from NPPs.\n\nThe technical safety objective for existing NPPs has a \u201ctarget likelihood\u201d for the occurrence of severe core damage of below 10\u20134 events per plant operating year. Implementation of all\n\nsafety principles for future plants should lead to the achievement of an improved goal of not \u20135 more than 10 events per plant operating year. Severe accident management and mitigation measures should reduce the probability of a large off-site release requiring an off-site response by a factor of at least 10 (see 2.3 of IAEA 75-INSAG-3:1999).\n\nA.3 Plant safety analysis\n\nA.3.1 General\n\nA safety analysis of the nuclear plant design is performed to establish and confirm the design basis for the items important to safety and to ensure that the overall plant design is capable of meeting the limits and reference levels for radiological doses and releases set by the regulatory authority for each plant condition category (see Clause 5 of IAEA NS-R-1:2000).\n\nThe scope of the safety analysis might include:\n\n\u2022 the demonstration that operational limits and conditions are satisfied for the normal operation of the plant;\n\n\u2022 characterisation of the PIEs that are appropriate for the plant design and its location;\n\n\u2022 an analysis and evaluation of event sequences which result from PIEs;\n\n\u2022 comparison of the results of the analysis with radiological acceptance criteria and design limits;\n\n\u2022 establishing and confirming of the design basis;\n\n\u2022 a demonstration that the management of anticipated operational occurrences and accident conditions is possible by response of the automatic safety systems in combination with prescribed operator actions.\n\nThis plant safety analysis process is carried out in an iterative manner from the time of initial plant conceptual design to the final plant safety assessment and it takes into account all\n\nanalysis takes proper account of potential human errors in operational states and under accident conditions.\n\nThe objective of this analysis is to demonstrate that the actions which are specified to be carried out by the automatic systems and the operators will result in plant behaviour which maintains radiation doses to site personnel and the public below prescribed limits for normal operating, anticipated operational occurrences and accident conditions.\n\nA.3.2 Analysis of event sequences\n\nThe purpose of analysing an event sequence is to identify systematically and in detail all possible consequences of a PIE on the plant, including those arising from auxiliary and support systems and from possible operator error. The results of this event sequence analysis can then be used to determine if the safety requirements set down in the IAEA Code of Design have been met (see the appendices of IAEA NS-R-1:2000).\n\nUseful analytical tools for identifying possible plant states after a PIE are event tree analysis (qualitative) and fault-tree analysis (quantitative).\n\nIt is noted that it is neither possible nor necessary to include in the safety analysis every event sequence that might occur. However, the safety analysis has to identify and consider in detail those PIEs and event sequences that produce bounding cases for safety design. In making the choice of these event sequences, experience with existing plants is taken into account.\n\nEven with the restriction to bounding case event sequences, as described above, the rigorous application of event tree methodology will, in many practical situations, lead to the\n\nanalysed in detail. Therefore, it is usually admissible to restrict the detailed analysis to a number of representative event sequences.\n\nA.3.3 Assessment of design basis: deterministic/probabilistic methods\n\nMethods have been developed to assess whether safety objectives have been met (see IAEA 75-INSAG-3).\n\nIn the deterministic approach, design basis events are chosen to bound a range of related possible initiating events which could lead to a challenge to the safety of the plant.\n\nProbabilistic analysis is used to evaluate the likelihood of any particular sequence and its consequences. This evaluation may take into account the effects of mitigation measures inside and outside the plant.\n\nDeterministic versus probabilistic approach: The lack of sufficient data on component or system behaviour or the inability to specify a suitable mode may prevent a rigorous quantitative probabilistic approach. However, a partial probabilistic approach may often be supplemented by qualitative engineering judgement. A deterministic approach on the other hand requires engineering judgement that implicitly contains some qualitative probabilistic considerations.\n\nIn essence, current practice is to use the deterministic approach to design the systems and the probabilistic approach to optimise appropriate parts of the design and to evaluate the overall safety.\n\nA.4 Defence in depth\n\nA major contribution to the safety philosophy is provided by the defence-in-depth concept. This concept should be applied to all safety activities, whether organisational, behavioural or\n\ndesign related, to ensure that there are overlapping safety provisions so that if a failure does occur, it would be compensated for or corrected (see IAEA NS-R-1; IAEA 75-INSAG-3; IAEA INSAG-10 and IAEA-NS-G-1.3).\n\nA first application of the concept of defence in depth to the design process is to provide independent but complementary sets of equipment and procedures in order to prevent accidents or to ensure appropriate protection in the event of prevention failing.\n\nExamples of the multiple levels of protection:\n\n\u2022 provision of multiple means for ensuring each of the basic safety functions, i.e. reactivity control, heat removal and the confinement of radioactivity;\n\n\u2022 use of reliable protective devices in addition to the inherent safety features;\n\n\u2022 supplementing of the plant control by automatic and operator actions;\n\n\u2022 provision of equipment and procedures to mitigate accident consequences.\n\nIn general, all the lines of defence have to be available at all times as specified for the various operational modes.\n\n\u2022 The aim of the first line of defence is to prevent deviation from normal operation. This requires that the plant be soundly and conservatively designed, constructed and operated in accordance with appropriate quality levels and engineering practices.\n\n\u2022 The aim of the second line of defence is to detect and intercept deviations from normal operation conditions in order to prevent anticipated operational occurrences from escalating into accident conditions.\n\n\u2022 For the third line of defence it is assumed that, although very unlikely, the escalation of certain anticipated operational occurrences may not be arrested by a preceding line of defence and so additional equipment and procedures are provided to control the consequences of the resulting accident conditions. A further major objective of this line of defence is to achieve stable and acceptable conditions following the accident.\n\n\u2022 Beyond the third line of defence, there are further contributions to the protection of the public by complementary plant features (not claimed as important to safety) and plans for emergency preparedness, which are largely independent of reactor design.\n\nA second application of the defence-in-depth concept is to construct and operate the NPP in such a manner that the radioactive materials are contained within a succession of physical barriers. These physical barriers are essentially passive and usually include the fuel itself, the fuel cladding, the reactor coolant system boundary, and the containment envelope. The design has to provide for the appropriate effectiveness and for the protection of each of these barriers.\n\nA complementary application of the defence-in-depth concept is single or multiple backup of I&C systems. To minimize the magnitude of a disturbance and to achieve defence in depth, more than one I&C system may be used, which act progressively as the controlled variable deviates from the desired value. At first, as the variable deviates from normal conditions, non classified control systems take action. Following the action of these control systems, one or more levels of additional control systems important to safety may intercede, prior to the actuation of the protection system, if the event grows from a minor operational disturbance to a minor transient and to a significant transient. At each stage, the purpose is to terminate the event and return the system to normal operation for minor events and to shut down safely for events which become more serious.\n\nAnnex B\n\n(informative)\n\nCategorisation of functions and classification of systems\n\nB.1 Background for the categorisation/classification scheme\n\nIAEA NS-R-1 establishes a list of safety functions which enable the plant design to meet the general safety requirements, from the means of safely shutting down the reactor to removing the residual heat from the core, and reducing the potential for the release of radioactive material. It establishes the idea of classification of fluid-containing components necessary to perform safety functions according to their importance to safety. It introduces a methodology for ranking safety functions and for the assignment of design requirements, based on the consequence of a failure of safety function, the probability that the function would be required and the probability that the function would not be accomplished when required.\n\nIAEA NS-G-1.3 expands the idea of classification to the instrumentation and control systems. It divides I&C systems into \"systems important to safety\" and \"systems not important to safety\". It then subdivides the systems important to safety into \"safety systems\" and \"safetyrelated systems\" and provides design requirements.\n\nIEC 61226 classifies the functions important to safety into three categories: A, B and C. It provides criteria for assignment of I&C functions to categories and design requirements for the associated systems and equipment.\n\nThe number of classes defined by IAEA differs from that of IEC 61226 (safety and safetyrelated systems versus categories A, B and C). Furthermore, IAEA and IEC do not use identical definitions and concepts (system classification in IAEA versus categorisation of functions/classification of systems in IEC), and these discrepancies may be the source of different interpretations.\n\nThis standard follows IEC 61226 concerning the subdivision in three classes, this fits typically to the different levels of assurance of the performance required and reliability achievable when using present I&C techniques and products (e.g. developed according to nuclear standards, selected and qualified commercial off-the-shelf equipment, selected commercial off-the-shelf equipment). However, in order to avoid ambiguities in the interpretation of requirements, separate gradation schemes respectively for the functions and the systems are adopted.\n\nThe basic assumptions on categorisation/classification of this standard are developed below.\n\nB.2 Rationale for the categorisation and classification principles adopted in\n\nthis standard\n\nB.2.1 General\n\nFunctions, systems and equipment of the NPP may be considered from two points of view (Figure B.1):\n\n\u2022 Functional point of view\n\nThis point of view considers only the functions to be performed. While it is recognised that sensors, processing units, interface units, etc are required to implement a function, the functional point of view does not consider that these items may be integrated into larger assemblies of equipment that also perform other functions (see \"Systems point of view\").\n\nThe means necessary to implement a function are called the systems and equipment associated with that function.\n\n\u2022 Systems point of view\n\nThis point of view considers the systems as an organised collection of equipment which implements multiple functions/subfunctions; for example, protection system, automation and control system, HMI system. The individual functions executed within a system may belong to different categories.\n\n+\n\n+\n\nActuation equipment\n\nequipment\n\nElectrical, mechanical, fluid systems\n\nFigure B.1 \u2013 Relations between I&C functions and I&C systems\n\nB.2.2 NPP process design phase\n\nThe NPP process designers analyse the plant and associated systems from a functional point of view. They define the plant and reactor specific PIEs and the functions important to safety needed to handle these PIEs to prevent them from developing into accident conditions. A number of independent functions (or subfunctions) may be required for each PIE according to the principle of defence in depth. The functions (or subfunctions) are assigned to categories A, B or C depending whether they play a principal, complementary, auxiliary or indirect role in the safety of the nuclear plant.\n\nCategorisation methods are normally based on deterministic, probabilistic and risk reduction considerations. They take into account different factors such as the probability and potential severity of the consequences of PIE if the I&C system provided fails, the length of time for which the function is required once it is initiated, the timeliness and reliability with which alternative actions may be taken or any failure in the I&C system may be remedied.\n\nThe categorisation process may allow I&C functions in a safety group to be placed in different categories, for example, a diverse reactor trip may be needed to function only under the unlikely conditions of an anticipated transient combined with the failure of the primary protection function. In this case, rather than being an I&C function of category A (to be implemented in a class 1 system), it may be down-graded to category B or C.\n\nThe categories indicate the level of design requirements as well as the minimal required class of the associated systems and equipment necessary for the implementation of the function.\n\nB.2.3 NPP I&C design phase\n\nThe NPP I&C designers analyse the I&C functions and associated systems and equipment from a systems point of view. They have the task of providing a number of I&C systems to implement the I&C functions with the level of quality and independence required by the process designers. The systems are assigned to classes depending on the achievable level of quality.\n\nThe process of classification and assignment of functions to computer based systems differs from the approach used for hard-wired technology because\n\n\u2022 in hard-wired technology, the functions are generally implemented singly in chains of separate electronic components or relays, but CB systems allow a number of functions to be executed within the same hardware components;\n\n\u2022 CB systems include a number of ancillary functions, for example self-supervision functions, diagnosis functions, which are not part of the plant design categorisation. These functions may need a lower level of qualification but require functional isolation;\n\n\u2022 the choice of system architecture may be restricted in order to limit the complexity to facilitate implementation of functions of high safety category;\n\n\u2022 there is a potential for the designer to include requirements on the architecture of the systems, for example functional separation, internal behaviour, complexity, provisions against CCF, which are not associated with the individual functions but are associated with the I&C systems and the properties of the equipment family used to implement these systems and the qualification of such systems.\n\nThis leads to the perceived need to establish a system of classification for I&C systems dependent on the function with the highest category that they execute.\n\nB.3 Categorisation of the I&C functions important to safety\n\nIt is assumed in this standard that the plant safety design base provided by the process designers defines the categorisation of the individual I&C functions important to safety in three categories A, B, C. The categorisation requirements identify, by implication, the degree of quality of the items that are used to implement the function.\n\nThe categorisation of I&C functions is completed to the subfunctions level (see Note) so that no additional analysis at the process level is required by the I&C engineers to complete the categorisation.\n\nNOTE A same function important to safety may be accomplished by the use of a number of subfunctions or by a unique function including all the subfunctions. This may create ambiguities when defining the requirements for the categorisation because the subfunctions may have different importance for safety and, as a consequence, different categories assigned to each of them.\n\nIn addition to the categorisation requirements, the plant safety design base defines the independence and diversity requirements of the individual functions to provide defence-indepth. Independence is required between functions providing different lines of defence in the same safety group, between a protection function and a risk reduction function.\n\nThe independence and diversity requirements are inputs to the process of assignment of the I&C functions to the I&C systems. The I&C functions may be distributed to different I&C systems, provided that these have adequate safety classification (see Clause B.2).\n\nB.4 Classification of the I&C systems\n\nThe I&C systems that make up the overall I&C architecture usually group together a number of I&C functions or subfunctions that perform similar tasks for the plant. The systems may normally be characterised by the functionality they provide. The number of I&C systems and their functionality is plant-specific. Typical examples of I&C systems important to safety are given below.\n\nThese systems control plant or equipment parameters to\n\n\u2022 maintain process variables within limits assumed in the safety analysis of the plant,\n\n\u2022 maintain a safe operation of plant systems and equipment important to safety,\n\n\u2022 minimize the magnitude and rate of disturbances which are credible,\n\n\u2022 minimize the frequency of occurrence of events which challenge the protection system. This can be accomplished by providing high-quality, redundant diverse automation and control systems or providing more than one level of action. For example, a combination of automatic control action and manual control actions if there is sufficient time to react correctly, or two or more of the above in combination.\n\nAutomation and control systems can affect safety because their performance, reliability, and consequences of failure form part of the design basis for the protection system. Automation and control systems may also be the principal means of accomplishing functions important to safety, for example, where an extensive period of time is available for corrective action.\n\nTypical functionality of these systems includes open-loop control, closed-loop control and execution of manually initiated control actions.\n\nThese systems inform the plant operator and others of the status of the plant and its systems important to safety. They are also used to support the operator decision-making process and allow initiation of manual control actions to maintain plant safety.\n\nTypical functionality of these systems is to\n\n\u2022 convert information from sensors or signals from other systems into information suitable for display or recording on indicators, CRTs, printers, etc. The system produces information such as overviews, alarm reduction, and operation guidance,\n\n\u2022 display alarms, warnings and other information,\n\n\u2022 provide interfaces to initiate manual control.\n\nThese systems ensure that specified design limits are not exceeded as a result of anticipated operational occurrences and that the consequences of accidents are contained within the design basis.\n\nThe typical functionality of these systems is as follows:\n\n\u2022 sensing accident conditions and automatically initiating the operation of appropriate systems including reactor shut-down;\n\n\u2022 prioritising between functions of different categories (for example, override actions of the control system).\n\nTypical functionality:\n\n\u2022 load shedding;\n\n\u2022 load sequencing of diesel generators and other supplies.\n\nThe I&C systems implementing functions important to safety are assigned to one of three classes which conform to defined design, manufacturing and qualification requirements, which\n\nmake these systems suitable for implementing functions of one or more of the categories A, B or C or unclassified (see Clause B.2). A typical classification of I&C systems is given in Table B.1.\n\nTable B.1 \u2013 Typical classification of I&C systems\n\nClass 1 Class 2 Class 3 Not classified\n\nPlant automation and control systems x x x\n\nHMI systems (class 1 HMI may be restricted to a few x x x x\n\nProtection system and safety actuation system x\n\nThe requirements of the function with the highest safety category determine the class of the system.\n\nAnnex C\n\n(informative)\n\nQualitative defence approach against CCF\n\nC.1 Example of assignment of functions of a safety group to systems\n\nB A C Functional categorisation Cat.\n\nFunctions\n\n** Associated design requirements\n\nClasses of I&C systems for implementation of functions\n\nClass 1* F F A1 A2 F Requirements for system properties B1 and qualification F A for equipment family\n\nF Class 2* X\n\nF F B C1\n\nF Class 3* C\n\nKey\n\nDifferent I&C equipment families F Scope of functions, associated to category A A\n\nF F F Separation of into two sets of diverse functions ** see table 5 F F ---F I&C systems with functions implemented A A1 A2\n\nF F X A\n\nFigure C.1 \u2013 Examples of assignment of functions of a safety group to I&C systems\n\nThe requirements on equipment properties and qualification, as for example, environmental and software robustness may be obtained by a suitable selected equipment family. The requirements for the systems focus on design features, as for example, the fault tolerances of the system architecture and the adequacy of the V&V design procedures adopted to ensure correct functionality.\n\nFigure C.1 shows some examples for the assignment of the functions of a safety group to I&C systems which reflect different design strategies to meet the required reliability. The strategies are chosen based on the analysis of the effectiveness of different measures against CCF.\n\nFA1---FA2: The scope of the safety group includes two functional diverse category A functions F and F The assessment of CCF analysis would need to show that for this case the A1 A2. application of functional diversity has given effective protection against CCF. The two\n\nfunctions are then implemented in independent class 1 systems based on the same equipment family.\n\nFA---FX: The scope of the safety group includes a main category A function FA1 and an additional category B or C, FX function as a means of back-up. The CCF analysis shall show in this case that the application of equipment diversity gives sufficient protection against the CCF of concern. The F function is assigned to one class 1 system and the Fx function is A implemented in a class 2 system based on a different equipment family to give equipment diversity.\n\nFB1---FB: The scope of the safety group includes two functional diverse category B functions FB1 and FB. The CCF analysis shall show that the application of equipment diversity and functional diversity gives sufficient protection against CCF that are of concern. The F B1 function is assigned to one class 1 system and the FB function is implemented in a class 2 system based on a different equipment family to give equipment diversity.\n\nThe case of FC1 and FC is similar to the previous one.\n\nC.2 Examples of CCF sensitivity in safety groups\n\nThe following typical situations may exist.\n\nTable C.1 \u2013 Examples of CCF sensitive in safety groups\n\nExample 1\n\nSafety group consisting of a system with three identical\n\nA\n\nPotential causes of CCF Possible defence\n\nPotential: (H) = High; (M) = Medium; (L) = Low Effectiveness: (H) = High; (M) = Medium; (L) = Low\n\n\u2013 An error in the requirement specification of the Independent verification of the specification (M)\n\n\u2013 A fault in the specification or development of the System development class 1 (H) application software or a fault in the system software module (M).

For example, the scope of Part 3 of IEC 61508, on software, is partially dealt with by IEC 60880 and IEC 62138.\n\nThis annex includes four clauses:\n\n\u2022 Clause D.2 identifies the main differences in the scopes and concepts of the two standards\n\n\u2022 Clause D.3 compares this standard with IEC 61508-1 (general requirements)\n\n\u2022 Clause D.4 compares this standard with IEC 61508-2 (system aspects)\n\n\u2022 Clause D.5 compares this standard with IEC 61508-4 (definitions)\n\nAbbreviations\n\nD.2 Comparison of scopes and concepts\n\nThe comparison first considers some important differences in the scopes of the two standards.\n\nThe systems discussed in IEC 61508 can be of any electric, electronic or programmable electronic technology, and, although this standard includes the principles of architectural requirements for the three technologies, its main focus is on computer-based systems.\n\nIEC 61508 refers to \u201csafety-related systems\u201d in general while this standard follows IAEA practice and refers to \u201csystems important to safety\u201d (i.e. important to nuclear safety).\n\nNOTE It is assumed that for the design of I&C systems in NPPs that implement conventional safety functions (e.g. to address worker safety, asset protection, chemical hazards, process energy hazards) international or national standards would be applied that are also based on the requirements of the basic safety standard IEC 61508.\n\na) Scope of the overall safety life cycle\n\nThe overall safety life cycle of IEC 61508 includes all of the systems provided by the safety design of the equipment under control including I&C systems (E/E/PE), other technology systems, and external risk reduction facilities.\n\nThis standard does not specifically discuss the plant safety analysis nor does it identify the means of assessing the adequacy of the performance and reliability requirements arising from the analysis. The nuclear sector practice is for the plant safety design to be performed according to specific IAEA principles, IEC rules and national regulations that\n\nare outside the scope of this standard. The plant design base defines the PIEs, their sequences, the defence in-depth concept of the plant, the categorisation of functions required to provide the defence. However, this standard does identify the input information required from the plant design base and safety analysis which shall be made available to the I&C developers to guide the subsequent design of the I&C systems.\n\nIn this standard, the overall verification and validation of each distributed function important to safety is recorded in the overall integration and commissioning report.\n\nIn the nuclear sector the assessment of the adequacy of this report with respect to safety is regulated in the framework of the licensing procedures.\n\nThe I&C systems of this standard are equivalent to E/E/PE systems in IEC 61508. In this standard, the system architecture (see Clause 5) defines a number of individual systems with defined classes and independence requirements which perform the functions important to safety. For each of these individual systems, Clause 6 defines an individual safety life cycle. In IEC 61508, any splitting into multiple systems is covered in Part 2.\n\nThis difference has to be kept in mind in order to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nIEC 61508 grades the safety integrity level required for a CB system according to the risk reduction the system is required to provide. This is arrived at by determining the severity of the risk associated with the hazard, and assessing the frequency of the hazard and the protection to be provided by the system to reduce the risk from the hazard to a tolerable level.\n\nThe nuclear industry has traditionally used a deterministic method to determine the safety significance of a system and its impact on the severity of risk associated with possible discharge of activity (see IAEA Safety Guides and IEC 61226).\n\nThe highest practicable integrity is generally deemed necessary for any system which prevents or mitigates the consequences of radioactive releases. A lower level of integrity may be acceptable for systems which support protection against there being releases, but do not directly prevent or mitigate them. Consequently, there is not an equivalent scheme to the reliability/risk reduction SIL levels proposed in IEC 61508 in common use in the nuclear sector. This deterministic approach has been found generally sufficient in the nuclear industry and has resulted in practice in the setting of very high targets of all protective functions. However, the nuclear sector does recognise the numerical approach, and methods of probabilistic safety analysis (PSA) may provide clearer targets for the reliability of CB systems.\n\nThe assignment of safety functions to \u201cintegrity levels\u201d of IEC 61508 is very similar to the categorisation of nuclear safety functions applied in the nuclear industry. However, there is a significant difference in the assignment procedure:\n\n\u2022 in IEC 61508, the assignment to safety integrity levels is based on a probabilistic hazard and risk analysis;\n\n\u2022 in IEC 61226, the assignment of nuclear safety functions to categories is based on deterministic criteria and engineering judgement about consequences in case of malfunction.\n\nD.3 Correspondence between IEC 61508-1 and this standard\n\nIEC 61508-1 IEC 61513\n\nthe activities connected to a nuclear plant are covered by a QA program or preferably an integrated\n\nIEC 61508-1 IEC 61513\n\nThe overall safety life cycle encompasses the E/E/PES, The overall I&C safety life cycle encompasses the I&C other technology, external risk reduction functions, systems and equipment important to safety and the overall architecture of I&C systems (see item a) of Clause D.2)\n\nDescription of the EUC, its required control functions Review of the plant safety design base (5.2):\n\n\u2013 to identify imposed environmental conditions (5.2.4)\n\n\u2013 the I&C functions important to safety\n\n\u2013 automatic versus operator actions\n\nIdentification of sources of hazard The internal and external hazards are defined by the safety design base of the plant and are an input for the I&C (5.2.4) (see item a) of Clause D.2)\n\nTo determine the boundary of the EUC To identify imposed plant/I&C boundaries (5.2.4)\n\nTo specify the scope of hazard and risk analysis and The events (PIEs) are defined by the safety design base accident-initiating events of the plant and are an input for the I&C (5.2) (see item a) of Clause D.2)\n\nIdentification of hazard of EUC...

In this standard, the assessment of reliability is normally NOTE 3 In determining safety integrity, all causes of qualitative (see 6.2.2.2.2) failures (both random hardware failures and systematic (see 6.2.2.2 and 6.2.4.2.2) failures) which lead to an unsafe state should be included, for example hardware failures, software induced failures and failures due to electrical interference. Some of these types of failure, in particular random hardware failures, may be quantified using such measures as the failure rate in the dangerous mode of failure or the probability of a safety-related protection system failing to operate on demand. However, the safety integrity of a system also depends on many factors which cannot be accurately quantified but can only be considered qualitatively.\n\nTopic: Classification of systems important to safety\n\nIEC 61508-4 IEC 61513\n\ndiscrete level (one of the four possible) for specifying All safety-related components, structures and systems the safety integrity requirements of the safety functions are classified on the basis of their functions and to be allocated to the E/E/PE safety-related systems, significance with regard to safety, and they are so where safety integrity level 4 has the highest level of designed, manufactured and installed that their quality is safety integrity and safety integrity level 1 has the commensurate with that classification lowest (Clause 78 of IAEA 75-INSAG-3:1999)\n\nIEC 61226 sets a limit on the reliability that may be claimed (10\u20134) for systems which incorporate software.\n\nFor some systems, reliability targets may exceed values which can be demonstrated. If it is necessary to ensure this greater functional reliability, additional independent systems are used, each of which is capable of performing the assigned safety function.
